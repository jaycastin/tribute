        <p>Carlos J. Finlay was a Cuban epidemiologist recognized as a pioneer in the research of yellow fever, determining that it was transmitted through mosquitoes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First to theorize, in 1881, that a mosquito was a carrier of the organism causing yellow fever.</li>
            <li>His theory was followed by the recommendation to control the mosquito popuplation as a way to control the spread of the disease.</li>
            <li>His hypothesis and exhaustive proofs were confirmed nearly twenty years later by the Walter Reed Commission of 1900.</li>
